This README describes the process of designing robot legs using Cinema 4D. The design features three joints per leg and includes space for servo motors and mounting screws.

## Overview

Cinema 4D is a powerful 3D modeling, animation, and rendering application used for creating detailed and precise 3D models. In this project, Cinema 4D was used to design robot legs with three joints per leg, incorporating spaces for servo motors and mounting provisions for screws.

## Design Specifications

1. **Joints**: Each leg is designed with three joints:
   - **Hip Joint**: Provides movement relative to the robot's body.
   - **Knee Joint**: Allows bending motion for the leg.
   - **Ankle Joint**: Offers fine adjustments and stabilization.

2. **Servo Motor Provisions**: 
   - **Hip Motor**: Space is allocated for a servo motor at the hip joint.
   - **Knee Motor**: Space is allocated for a servo motor at the knee joint.
   - **Ankle Motor**: Space is allocated for a servo motor at the ankle joint.

3. **Mounting Provisions**: 
   - **Screw Holes**: Precisely placed holes for screws to secure components and joints.

## Design Process

1. **Create Leg Model**:
   - **Start a New Project**: Open Cinema 4D and create a new project file.
   - **Basic Structure**: Use the **Primitive** shapes (e.g., cylinders and cubes) to build the basic structure of the robot leg.
   - **Joints Design**: Use the **Extrude** and **Bevel** tools to create the joints, ensuring they provide flexibility and proper fit.

2. **Include Provisions for Servo Motors**:
   - **Add Motor Spaces**: Design placeholders or spaces where servo motors will be mounted. Note that the actual servo motors are not included in the Cinema 4D model.

3. **Add Mounting Holes**:
   - **Create Holes**: Use the **Boolean** tool to cut holes for screws. Ensure the holes are accurately placed for easy assembly and secure mounting.

4. **Refine and Finalize**:
   - **Review Design**: Use the **Move**, **Scale**, and **Rotate** tools to adjust and refine the design.
   - **Check Dimensions**: Ensure all dimensions are accurate and align with the servo motor specifications.
   - **Export**: Export the finalized model in the desired format (e.g., STL) for 3D printing or further processing.

## Cinema 4D Tools Overview

### **Primitive Objects**
- **Purpose**: Create the basic shapes for your model.
- **Usage**: Use shapes like cylinders and cubes to form the legs and joints.

### **Extrude Tool**
- **Purpose**: Extend a surface or edge to add depth to your model.
- **Usage**: Extrude primitive shapes to create the legs and joints with the desired thickness.

### **Bevel Tool**
- **Purpose**: Smooth or chamfer edges and corners.
- **Usage**: Use this tool to add smooth transitions and rounded edges to the joints and mounting areas.

### **Spline Tool**
- **Purpose**: Create complex shapes and paths.
- **Usage**: Draw the outline of servo motor mounts and use it to guide the extrusion process.

### **Boolean Tool**
- **Purpose**: Combine or subtract shapes to create complex geometries.
- **Usage**: Use this tool to cut precise screw holes and other features into your model.

### **Move, Scale, Rotate Tools**
- **Purpose**: Adjust the position, size, and orientation of objects.
- **Usage**: Fine-tune the placement and alignment of components to ensure accuracy.

## Exporting the Design

1. **Save the Project**: Save your Cinema 4D project file (*.c4d) to retain your design and enable future modifications.
2. **Export the Model**: Export the design in a suitable format for 3D printing or further processing:
   - **STL**: Common format for 3D printing.
   - **OBJ**: Versatile format for use in various applications.

## Final Design

## Notes

- Verify all dimensions and clearances to ensure compatibility with servo motors and mounting hardware.
- Double-check alignment of screw holes and motor spaces to ensure proper fit during assembly.
